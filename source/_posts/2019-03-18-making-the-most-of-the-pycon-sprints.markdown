## Your fears going into the sprints


### I'm not experienced enough

I've **never contributed to an open source project** before and I don't really know what to do.
I'm a **junior programmer** and I'm afraid I'm not experienced enough.
I **don't write code for a living** and I'm afraid I won't be able to get anything done because I don't know how to *do* much yet.

The sprints are a great place for a first-time open source contributor.
You don't often get to sit next to the maintainer of the project you're contributing to and get their feedback in-person: TODO.

If you're a junior programming or you don't code for a living you might be afraid of your inexperience: maybe you're pretty new to coding in general and you don't understand git, testing, version control, and GitHub.
There's very likely a project for *you* to contribute to.
The sprints include sprint coordinators who can help point you to projects they've heard are particularly beginner-friendly or who have quite a bit of low-hanging fruit in their issue tracker for newcomers to dig into.

### It'll be too fast-paced for me

Sprints involve smart people coding for many hours on end, racing against the clock.
False.
From my experience, sprints usually aren't like that at all.

There are some very smart people at the sprints, but everyone at the sprints is new to *something* and there are many newcomers (and [mediocre programmers][]) at the sprints as well.

Some sprinters sit for many hours writing code, but the "pace" of the sprints is really up to you.
From my own experience, the name "sprints" is kind of a misnomer: **I never find myself *sprinting* while at the sprints**.

I've attended at least one day of sprints at PyCon US for each of the last 5 years and my sprint experience has almost always consisted of:

- Some **high level conversation** about an intriguing feature, topic, or idea
- Some **low level conversation** about how pieces of a project work (conversations about the inner-workings of a project are so much easier to have in-person)
- Some **writing time**.  Sometimes this is writing code.  Sometimes this is writing text copy for documentation or marketing material.  Sometimes it's my own writing time for a talk or article I'm working on.
- Some **rubber duck time**.  I often wander around asking people what they're working on and sometimes act as their [rubber duck][].  I also often wander around seeking my own rubber duck if I get stuck on a particular topic or idea (whether on my own person project or an open source project I'm contributing to).
- Plenty of **personal break time**.  I very often take mental breaks during sprints to wander the halls, often aimlessly.  Breaks feel great, but they also often help my subconscious work on a task for a bit while my conscious mind rests.

- Sprints involves smart people coding for many hours on end, racing against the clock
    - I've attended at least one day of sprints at PyCon US for each of the last 5 years and my sprint experience has never been like that
    - Sprints are probably intense for some people, but they certainly don't have to be
    - Often my sprints feel more relaxed than the main conference

### I won't be able to get enough done while I'm there

- Can I get up to speed quick enough to accomplish something by the end of the day?
- I have one day to work on a project that I don't really understand: what can I really get done in that time?

## What to expect

- Different projects sprint in different ways
- Some projects go out of their way to welcome contributions from newcomers while a few projects might hold a sprint that's focused on engaging existing contributors primarily (you're less likely to stumble upon those).
- I recommend picking a project to sprint on that seems particularly newcomer friendly

- During the sprints, project maintainers are often focused on enabling your contributions.  They can quietly write code at home, but it's hard for them to encourage *you* to quietly write code at home.  So many project maintainers consider it their primary responsibility to help you contribute to their project during the sprints.
- If you contribute to a project during sprints, it's more likely you'll decide to contribute to the project again *after* the sprints.  That would be great for them (they're getting your help) and might be quite fun for you to (you get to contribute to an open source project).

## How to get the most out of the sprints

### Try to prepare yourself for the setup time

- Getting started can take a lot of time, so prepare yourself
    - Try to get your machine prepared as much as you can before the first day of sprints: install git, get a modern version of Python installed, and install a code editor you're comfortable with.  This will reduce the time you lose on your first sprint day on setup.
    - Get an early start on setting up the project if possible
        - The sooner you figure out a project you'd like to sprint on, the sooner you can clone the repo, install third-party dependencies, figure out how to run the tests, and generally get your development environment setup
        - Any project you choose will likely require some dev environment setup
        - The setup process can sometimes take longer than expected (sometimes it's even buggy and fixing the instructions will end up being your first pull request)
    - If you get the pleasure to meet the maintainer of a project you'd like to contribute to the night before sprints, ask them their recommendations for what you can do to prepare
    - Show up early.  The project maintainer may not show up early, but that's okay.  If you have a project in mind, you can at least make sure your dev environment is setup and pick out a couple issues to ask the project maintainer about when they arrive.

### Ask for help

- If the maintainer of the project your sprinting on is in the room they're likely there because they want to help you contribute to their project.  Their job today isn't to write code, it's to help you.  Please don't forget to ask for help when you need it.
- Struggling is a great way to learn, but don't let yourself flounder for too long on issues that aren't your area of expertise.
- If you get stuck, attempt to fix your problem by Googling and trial and error, talk to your rubber duck (or your neighbor if they're willing to act as a rubber duck would), and you're still stuck... ask for help!

- Opening a pull request isn't the end of your sprinting journey: often PRs require more work before merging.  If you have time and the willpower to follow through, don't drop out after opening your pull request.
- Expect to get started at the sprints, not finish
    - Ask the maintainers what form of communication is best for questions you have regarding your contributions while at home


## Running your own sprint

Running your own sprint (running your own sprint could be a whole article on its own, but I wanted to give a few quick tips for folks who might be attempting to run a sprint on their own project or help a fellow maintainer run a sprint)
